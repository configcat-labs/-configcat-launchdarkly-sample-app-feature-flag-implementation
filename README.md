# Showing how to implement feature flags by using both ConfigCat's and LaunchDarkly's solutions

## College campus management system app

This repository contains a demo application called "college campus management system," which allows managing student records. The app's new feature is a new React component named "TableCaption" that adds new functionality to the app. It sums up the types and numbers of students. The feature is toggled on and off using the ConfigCat and LaunchDarkly feature flag services.
